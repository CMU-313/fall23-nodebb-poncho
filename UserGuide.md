#Anonymous Feature and Courses Taken on Profile Feature

## Feature Objectives
Being able to post anonymously as a user, and being able to add the courses you've taken to your user profile for professors or recruiters to see. The addition of the anonymous feature and courses taken on your profile feature serves to promote interaction and create more value in using NodeBB.

## User Stories
Currently NodeBB provides the basic functionality of having discussions, being able to view popular posts, and personalizing necessary information for your user profile. However as a user who wants to interact with others in discussions, there are many more situations that can lead to new functionalities being added.

1. As a student, I wish to be able to post anonymously because I don't want others to know what I posted if I feel like I have "dumb questions."
2. As a student, I wish to be able to write about the courses I have taken, so that recruiters and professors can see what courses I've taken and get an idea on the knowledge I may have.
